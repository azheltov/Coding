Scalability and Big O

// in JS we can use timers - let t0 = performace.now() - to measure the performnce and illustrate how many milliseconds certain task take

Runtime matters
Other factors: CPU power, other programs and etc.

What is good code?
1.Readable
2.Scalability

O(n) - Liner time
number of operations depends on the input 
n - size of input

O(1) - Constant
(flat line)
example with boxes, we take just one box list[0] so input doesn't affect the result

O(n^2) same as O(n * n)
nested loops

Rule 1: Worst Case

Rule 2: Remove Constants

Rule 3: Different terms for inputs                             |||||||| different inputs different variables

Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants
