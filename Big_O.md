O(n) - Liner time
number of operations depends on the input 
n - size of input

O(1) - Constant
(flat line)
example with boxes, we take just one box list[0] so input doesn't affect the result

O(n^2) same as O(n * n)
nested loops

Rule 1: Worst Case

Rule 2: Remove Constants

Rule 3: Different terms for inputs                              #different inputs different variables

Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants
